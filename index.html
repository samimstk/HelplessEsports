         royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary
          of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on
           previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene 
           for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale,
            and expanded into astandalone game under Greene's creative direction. 
            In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and 
            scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding 
            getting.

    Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of
     competition using video games.[1] Esports often takes the form of organized,
     multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional 
     players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long
      been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until
       late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in 
       these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity.[2][3]
        By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry
        , with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for
         tournaments and other events.
The most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer online 
attle arena (MOBA), first-person shooter (FPS), fighting, card, battle royale and
al-time strategy (RTS) games. Popular esport franchises include League of Legends
Dota, Counter-Strike, Valorant, Overwatch, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros. and
 StarCraft, among many others. Tournaments such as the League of Legends World
  Championship, Dota 2's International, the fighting game-specific Evolution
   Championship Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme Masters are among the most popular 
   in esports. Many other competitions use a series of league play with sponsored
   teams, such as the Overwatch League. Although the legitimacy of esports as a
    true sporting competition remains in question, they have been featured
     alongside traditional sports in some multinational events in Asia, with 
     the International Olympic Committee also having discussed their inclusion
      into future Olympic events.
